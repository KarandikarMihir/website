    "teaser": "So I’ve been writing React apps for a year now. I’ve had the honor of being one of the maintainers of react-boilerplate. If you’re a React developer, you know how it is- You get the mock-ups, you get the API endpoints and then you write the components. Easy-peasy. But over the period of time it becomes mundane.
